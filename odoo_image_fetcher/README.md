# Odoo 17 CE E-commerce Image Fetcher

This is a custom Odoo module developed to dynamically fetch and display main product images and extra product media from external URLs on the Odoo 17 CE e-commerce website. This module does not store these images in the Odoo database.

## Requirements

1. Fetching Images from URLs:
   - Module accepts URLs for main product images and extra media.
   - Asynchronous requests are implemented to handle image fetching without affecting page load times.

2. Displaying Images:
   - Integrated with the existing e-commerce product templates to display images.
   - Compatibility ensured with various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).

3. Error Handling:
   - Error handling implemented for broken URLs or unavailable images.
   - A default placeholder image is provided in case of errors.

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Image URLs are cached to minimize repeated requests.
   - Optimized for different screen sizes and devices.

5. User Interface:
   - An easy-to-use interface is provided in the backend for admins to enter and update image URLs.

6. Security:
   - The image fetching process is secure and does not expose the system to vulnerabilities.

## Implementation Steps

1. Setup Development Environment:
   - Install Odoo 17 CE and necessary dependencies.

2. Module Skeleton:
   - Create a new custom module with the necessary directory structure.

3. Model Extension:
   - Extend the `product.template` model to include fields for image URLs.

4. Backend Interface:
   - Develop backend views for URL input using Odoo's QWeb system.

5. Image Fetching Logic:
   - Implement Python methods to handle asynchronous fetching of images.

6. Frontend Integration:
   - Modify existing e-commerce product templates to integrate the external images.
   - Ensure responsive design for image display.

7. Testing:
   - Perform unit tests for backend functionality.
   - Conduct UI tests for frontend integration.

8. Documentation:
   - Document the module's setup, configuration, and usage instructions.

9. Deployment:
   - Guide for deploying the module in a production environment.

## Testing Criteria

1. Functionality Testing:
   - Ensure images are correctly fetched and displayed.
   - Verify handling of broken or invalid URLs.

2. Performance Testing:
   - Assess the impact on page load times.
   - Validate caching mechanisms.

3. Security Testing:
   - Check for vulnerabilities introduced by external image fetching.

4. Compatibility Testing:
   - Test on various browsers and devices for responsive behavior.
